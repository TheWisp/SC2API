# SC2API

SC2API is a free C++ framework intended for AI projects to interact with Blizzard's RTS game, Starcraft 2. The library handles game state in a similar way to [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi) in that information hidden to the local player is not available through the framework.

SC2API is a third party "hack" of the game based on reverse engineering, and thus violates the EULA of the game. In order to prevent SC2API being misused as a maphack, the internal code of the library is kept closed source. Instead, binary versions of the library (dll) are provided, and kept up to date with the game version.

## Supported game client
StarCraft II 3.11.0 (51149), 32 bit Windows. 

## How to use

ExampleAI solution can be built with VS2015; by default the output files are located at Binaries/$(Configuration). That's also where other necessary SC2API files are located. Currently, SC2API only supports the 32 bit Windows client. Run SC2APILoader.exe and then [**run Starcraft 2 as 32 bit**](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/6680). The loader program will load SC2API.dll into the game, which then loads ExampleAI.dll.

If you create your own project using SC2API, please make sure the result dll is put along with other necessary files. You might need to open DreamSC2.ini and DreamSC2Default.ini to change the following section:

```ini
[SC2API]
AIModule=ExampleAI
```

where the value is name of the dll to be loaded.
